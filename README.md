# HackerYou - Technical Challenge 2019
After one year of getting rejected from HackerYou's Web Development Immersive bootcamp, I decided to apply again for the 2020 winter cohort. You didn't think I was going to give up that easily, did you?

This repository is dedicated how I am tackling the technical challenge this time around. Based on the feedback that I got in my previous attempt, I have to improve on the following:

 1. Build the site with **accessibility** in mind
 2. Use the **correct folder structure**
 3. Recreate the site **pixel by pixel**

## Planning
Since I failed to recreate the site accurately in my previous attempt, I basically reverse engineered the image provided. I opened up Adobe Photoshop and started tracing all the content blocks as accurately as I could. 

Here's the result:
